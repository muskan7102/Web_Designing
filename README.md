# Web_Designing
This is a website made for some college . The idea for few things are taken from my college website.I have learnt this from W3schools so thre might be some similarity in the codes .This website is made purely on the basis of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.The website opens with home page which has a navigation bars and various links to go to other sites plus there is also a student teacher login which takes username and password also password has some conditions like uppercase and and min 6 char .With correct password format the person can login and register .This is very basic website due to shortage of time and I can make even better.Please give me the chance .Looking Forwrd for this opportunity.
